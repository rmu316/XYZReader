Issues with XYZReader

- Color scheme is horrific
	- gray & white background
 	- light gray text color
	- on details page, weird having gray header with brownish-green title background

- Photos are awkwardly displayed
	- some take a long time to load
	- fixed sizes of photos (regardless of device rotation and screen size)
	- no rounded edges to photos
	- on details page, photo displayed on top left corner near back button is weirdly placed
	- Should have a photo on the center of the details page

- App Layout
	- main page layout is un-intuitive
	- weird amounts of white space on each article post in the main page
	- extra white space in top center part of details page (should add a photo there)
	- extra space in title background on main page
